# nbaStats

In this project, I used a primitive neural network to determine if the amount of three-pointers shot and three-point field goal percentage can predict whether an NBA team will win or lose a game. The basketball data had some level of noise, so it was necessary to standardize the data. The data was split into testing and training sets. Then, the input parameters were propagated through a 3-layered neural network. In order to check if there was a statistical significance I used a T-test adapted for neural networks.
